# quickstart

One can use **mosaic_gpt.py** to quickstart,only to change the **img_dir** and **label_dir** in the **main function**

I also make mixup in **mixup.py**, it is simple.

You also can change **random_num** to control the num of output_images

ps: this is my first code on github,If there is anything inappropriate, please forgive me.



THANKS!!
